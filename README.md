Simple Java Text Editor üìù
This project is a straightforward text editor built with Java Swing. It provides a clean and simple interface for basic text editing tasks. Key features include a file menu that allows you to create new documents, open existing text files, and save your work, as well as an edit menu with standard cut, copy, and paste functionality. A handy status bar is located at the bottom of the window, which displays a real-time count of both words and characters as you type.

To run this application, you will need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. First, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where the TextEditor.java file is saved. Compile the code by executing the command javac TextEditor.java. Once the compilation is complete, you can launch the program by running java TextEditor. The text editor window will then appear on your screen.
